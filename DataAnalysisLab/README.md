Our task is to compare the effectiveness of three different regression models in the binary classification of wine data. 
In this project, we will apply the following approaches:

1. Logistic regression – a classical probabilistic method that enables binary classification based on the available
   features describing the wine.
2. Logistic regression with PCA – an approach involving dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
   followed by logistic regression for classification.
3. Relaxed LASSO – a regression method that integrates variable selection and regularization, allowing us to identify
   the key features distinguishing white wines from red wines.

The aim of the project is to determine which of these methods most effectively classifies wines as white or red, 
based on their chemical and sensory characteristics.
