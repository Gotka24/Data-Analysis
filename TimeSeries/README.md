This project focuses on the analysis and modeling of a time series in R. 
The goal was to assess the stationarity of the data, identify trends and seasonality, 
and fit various forecasting models such as regression models, AR, MA, and ARIMA. 
The project allowed for comparing forecast accuracy and selecting the best model 
for predicting future values of the time series.
